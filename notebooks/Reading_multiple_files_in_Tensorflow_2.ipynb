    "In this post, we will read multiple `.csv` files into Tensorflow using generators. But the method we will discuss is general enough to work for other file formats as well. We will demonstrate the procedure using 500 `.csv` files. These files have been created using random numbers. Each file contains only 1024 numbers in one column. This method can easily be extended to huge datasets involving thousands of `.csv` files. As the number of files becomes large, we can't load the whole data into memory. So we have to work with chunks of it. Generators help us do just that conveniently. In this post, we will read multiple files using a custom generator.\n",

First, a folder named \"random_data\" will be created in current working directory and `.csv` files will be saved in it. Subsequently files will be read from that folder and processed. Just make sure that your current working directory doesn't have an old folder named \"random_data\". Then run the following codes.

Using the `tf_data_generator` create three tensorflow datasets corresponding to train, validation, and test data respectively. Finally, we will create a simple CNN model. Train it using train dataset, see its performance on validation dataset, and obtain prediction using test dataset. Keep in mind that our aim is not to improve performance of the model. As the data are random, don't expect to see good performance. The aim is only to create a pipeline. \n",

As we had planned in the beginning, we have created random data files, a generator, and trained a model using that generator. The above code can be tweaked slightly to read any type of files other than `.csv`. And now we can train our model without worrying about the data size. Whether the data size is 10GB or 750GB, our approach will work for both.\n",

The approach I have chosen seemed natural to me. I have neither strived for efficiency nor elegance. If readers have any better idea, I would be happy to know of it.\n",

If you run into this problem and are unable to solve it, contact the author. A blog discussing this speedup technique will be posted later."
