    "# How wavelet packet energy features were calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "While applying (shallow) machine learning algorithms for condition monitoring task, we first calculate features from raw time domain data and then apply the algorithms to the feature matrix. In our code demonstrations we have extensively used wavelet packet energy as well as wavelet packet entropy features. In this notebook, we will show how to calculate wavelet packet energy features. Wavelet packet energy and wavelet packet entropy features can be calculated in Python and R. But we will use MATLAB to calculate it. We do so, because our aim is to reproduce the same feature matrix that we have used in all our algorithms from raw time domain data. In Python and R, equivalent commands are not available (to the best of my knowledge) that can reprodce the feature matrix that we use in our experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update**: See [this notebook](https://github.com/biswajitsahoo1111/cbm_codes_open/blob/master/notebooks/Wavelet_packet_energy_features_python.ipynb) to compute wavelet packet energy features entirely in Python. As we have mentioned above, the feature matrix obtained using Python will not be exactly equal to the feature matrix that we have used in our analysis. But it will be close."
